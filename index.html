    Q: What is the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: The CABD is a standardized database of barriers to freshwater connectivity across Canada being developed by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. The database is designed to support habitat status assessments and reporting, informing management and decisions, restoration planning and prioritization, infrastructure asset management, research and monitoring programs, and education and public outreach initiatives. If you have questions, comments, or feedback you can contact us by email at <a href="mailto: cabd@cwf-fcf.org">cabd@cwf-fcf.org</a>.
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
    Q: How can I access the CABD? Do I need any special software?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: You can access the CABD through any browser by visiting <a href="https://aquaticbarriers.ca/" target="_blank">https://aquaticbarriers.ca/</a>. Additional software is not required to explore the data. If you'd like to use software like Google Earth or ArcGIS to explore further, the data will be available for download in a variety of file formats as part of a future release.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
    Q: What kind of data is available?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: Data related to dams, waterfalls, fishways, and hydrographic (stream, river, and lake) networks are currently available. For each dataset, we've compiled a set of information describing features that can be used for further analysis, such as dam use, construction type, waterfall height, fishway type, and construction year. A complete list of attributes can be found here: [link to simplified data dictionary]

    Q: What can I use the CABD for?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: We encourage you to use the CABD and its data for any projects where you need high-quality data about barriers and stream networks. Some opportunities to use the CABD in your work might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Reporting on the state of fish and fish habitat in a watershed
    </li>
    <li>
    Prioritizing barriers for remediation to improve fish passage
    </li>
    <li>
    Monitoring the effectiveness of fish passage improvement projects
    </li>
    <li>
    Creating an inventory of barrier infrastructure locations and conditions
    </li>
    </ul>

    Q: What updates are planned for the next phase of the CABD?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: We're working on a few key steps as part of Phase 2 of the CABD, including expanding the search, filter, and download capabilities, filling data gaps, and adding new barrier types like stream crossings. Once complete, you will be able to search based on barrier name and waterbody name; filter barriers by province/territory, watershed, and selected attributes; and download data as a CSV, shapefile, geopackage, or KML.
