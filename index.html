    Q: What is the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: The CABD is a standardized database of barriers to freshwater connectivity across Canada being developed by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. The database is designed to support habitat status assessments and reporting, informing management and decisions, restoration planning and prioritization, infrastructure asset management, research and monitoring programs, and education and public outreach initiatives.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
    Q: How can I access the CABD? Do I need any special software?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: You can access the CABD through any browser by visiting <a href="https://aquaticbarriers.ca/" target="_blank">https://aquaticbarriers.ca/</a>. Additional software is not required to explore the data. If you'd like to use software like Google Earth or ArcGIS to explore further, the data will be available for download in a variety of file formats as part of a future release.

    Q: What kind of data is available?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    A: Data related to dams, waterfalls, fishways, and hydrographic (stream, river, and lake) networks are currently available. For each dataset, we've compiled a set of information describing features that can be used for further analysis, such as dam use, construction type, waterfall height, fishway type, and construction year. A complete list of attributes can be found here: [link to simplified data dictionary]
